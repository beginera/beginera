Hi Sir, I am writing to formally resign from my position as developer at Balbhas Business Sysnomics , effective 28 february 2025. 
I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Balbhas and am grateful for the opportunities for growth and development that I have experienced during my tenure here. 
However, after careful consideration, Due to a chronic medical condition requiring ongoing treatment and rest, I am unable to fulfill my job responsibilities effectively. After medical consultation, I have decided to step down to focus on my health.
I want to express my sincere appreciation for the support and guidance and the entire team have provided me during my time here. 
It has been a pleasure working with such talented and dedicated individuals. I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition during my remaining time here and am willing to assist in any way to help train my replacement or wrap up any ongoing projects. Thank you again for the opportunity to be a part of the Balbhas team. I look forward to staying in touch and wish the company continued success in the future. 
Sincerely, 
Damodharan P S
